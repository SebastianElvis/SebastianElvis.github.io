<p class="indent"><a class="calibre9" id="page_510"></a>Three men played critical roles in the open fight to defeat the communists. Raja was superb. His fighting spirit never flagged. After the Barisan mounted their attacks on us in mid-1961, when everything looked bleak and we were in the depths of despair, Raja roared like a lion. They reviled the PAP as turncoats and renegades who had sold out the people; Raja answered in terms as pungent, rebutting and debunking them. He put his pamphleteering skills to work, and his robustness stiffened everybody’s morale. He was convinced that we were in the right, that we must fight, and that we would win.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, Pang Boon – quiet and soft-spoken, dependable and reliable, good in his assessments of who were loyal at PAP headquarters and in the party branches. He kept our loyalists together and in good heart, so that we had Chinese-educated party workers who became the core of an election organisation. Together with the grassroots community leaders, this made up for what had been demolished by the defecting Barisan supporters when the PAP split.</p>
<p class="indent">But my most important backroom player was Keng Swee, with his clear mind and sharp pen. He helped me refine the tactics that defeated the communists. For every clever move they made, we worked out a counter-move. Throughout this fight and for the next 21 years until he retired as deputy prime minister in 1984, he was my <em class="calibre2">alter ego</em>, always the sceptic, always turning a proposition on its head to reveal its flaws and help me reshape it. He was my resident intellectual <em class="calibre2">par excellence</em> and a doughty fighter. There were several other stalwarts, but these three stood out.</p>
