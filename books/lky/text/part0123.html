<p class="indent"><a class="calibre9" id="page_597"></a>It was a gruelling trip. In every city I made speeches, gave interviews on radio and television, and addressed university audiences and the press. It was well worth the effort. I put across a realistic picture of Malaysia and left New Zealanders and Australians in no doubt that we needed and valued their help, that they were right to help us, and that together, we could succeed.</p>
<p class="indent">When I returned to Singapore on 3 April, I found the Alliance leaders angry, alleging that I had been critical of the federal government and the Tunku. Even while I was still in Australia, V.T. Sambanthan, the MIC leader and the Tunku’s minister for posts, works and telecommunications, hit out at me “for speaking indifferently” about the Alliance. He said I had got what I wanted, namely Malaysia, and now spoke of the government as being ignorant of politics and run by princes, sultans and chiefs. But I had not said this in any of my speeches.</p>
<p class="indent">As the attacks on me continued in the Malaysian papers, several Australians and New Zealanders wrote to the <em class="calibre2">Straits Times</em> to defend me. An Australian journalist protested that he had heard me speak several times to university audiences, and at no time had he heard me say anything disparaging about the Malaysian leaders. The president of the Asian Studies Society of Victoria University in Wellington also wrote in to say he was surprised to hear reports from Malaysia that I had been criticised for making “irresponsible statements attacking leaders of the central government”. Nothing he had heard supported these allegations.</p>
<p class="indent">The truth was that my first sin in the eyes of the Alliance leaders was to have received a favourable press in New Zealand and Australia. They also knew from the Malaysian high commissioners in Wellington and Canberra that I had been warmly received by both prime ministers and their cabinets. But their main grievance was that my arguments and <a class="calibre9" id="page_598"></a>my analysis of the situation had carried weight with both governments. Following the barrage of accusations that I had maligned the Tunku, his ministers and Malaysia generally, I issued a statement that everything I said had been recorded on tape, it was available for checking, and I stood by every word of it. I specifically denied accusing the central government of working only for the Malays as Dr Lim Swee Aun of the MCA, the federal minister for commerce and industry, had claimed, and released a verbatim extract of what I had said on special Malay rights in answer to a question from a Malaysian student in Adelaide:</p>
<p class="blq-normal">“No, I don’t think that the issue at the moment is the clause providing for special rights for the Malays. … And if the immigrant communities of people of immigrant stock do not see the problems, if they can’t feel what it is like to be a poor Malay, and don’t feel for him, then I say very soon he will manifest his disaffection in a very decisive way and the whole country will be thrown into turmoil.”</p>
<p class="indent">My charge was not that there were special rights for the Malays, but that they would not solve the problems because they favoured only a few at the top:</p>
<p class="blq-normal">“How does giving bus licences or licences to run bus companies to one or two hundred Malay families solve the problem of Malay poverty? The Malays are farmers. In Australia and New Zealand, all the farmers are wealthy people. How is it that in Malaysia farmers are poor? Because there is no agricultural research, seed selection, fertilisation, improvement in double-cropping techniques, what cash crops you can grow.”</p>
<p class="indent">My statement was reported in the Chinese and English language newspapers but not in the Malay press. Nor was it carried on Radio &amp; Television Malaysia. So as far as the Malays were concerned, there was no denial by me, and the <em class="calibre2">Utusan Melayu</em> was able to keep on stirring up the ground against me.</p>
<p class="indent"><a class="calibre9" id="page_599"></a>The Tunku was angered, and warned Singapore leaders that the central government would not be pushed around by any state government on any matter. Singapore, he said, had come into the Federation “with their eyes wide open and on their own accord”. He added:</p>
<p class="blq-normal">(Singapore) “would perhaps have been made a second Cuba and the position for us would be untenable … and that was why the central government supported the PAP. With the return of the PAP into power, we considered that Singapore was safe from the communists. But little did we realise that the leader of the PAP had in his mind a share in the running of Malaysia. This we considered as unacceptable since the Alliance is strong enough to run the country on its own.”</p>
<p class="indent">Two weeks after my return to Singapore, I wrote a letter to Sir Robert Menzies summarising the difficulties of making a success of a multiracial society like Malaysia. In this letter, dated 20 April 1965, I set out the position as my colleagues and I saw it in April 1965. We felt in our bones that if things carried on as they did, something disastrous would happen.</p>
<p class="indent">Menzies’ reply in May 1965 was supportive but carefully balanced:</p>
<p class="blq-normal1">“I can assure you that I want to see, for all our sakes, a sensible and friendly settlement, which I am sure would make Malaysia a living and secure structure. Meanwhile, I urge patience as the constant companion of your unquestioned abilities.</p>
<p class="blq-indent">“I will not need to tell you that, if my own influence is to have significance, I must not form any judgements in advance and it must not be made to appear that I have done so.”</p>
<p class="indent1">He recognised that the Australian government would be hard put to justify to its electorate why they should defend a repressive Malay government that was putting down non-Malays – non-Malays who had willingly joined the Federation with a multiracial constitution to which the Tunku and Razak had agreed in London in July 1963.</p>
