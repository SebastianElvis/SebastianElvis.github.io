<p class="normal1a">I wrote my Memoirs for a younger generation of Singaporeans to know the story of the Singapore I grew up in. (<em class="calibre2">The Singapore Story</em> was published in 1999 and <em class="calibre2">From Third World to First</em> in 2000.) It was to give them an understanding of the difficulties Singapore faced then in its struggle to survive in the midst of larger, newly independent nations pursuing nationalistic policies.</p>
<p class="normal1a">It is a different world and a different Singapore today, a world vastly changed by globalization and technology but the threats remain and the challenge to national survival is grave.</p>
<p class="normal1a">It is my hope that the experiences of my generation find relevance with a generation that grew up with digital literacy and technology. I look forward to this digital version reaching out to that generation of online readers.</p>
