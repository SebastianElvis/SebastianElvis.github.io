<p class="fm-title"><a class="calibre7" id="page_616"></a>41. The Quest for a Malaysian Malaysia</p>
<p class="normal">The mood of the debate in the federal parliament carried over naturally to the Malaysian Solidarity Convention rally the following week in Singapore. On a warm, breezy Sunday morning, 6 June 1965, at the National Theatre, a large open-air amphitheatre with a cantilevered roof but no side walls, 3,000 people packed the seats and filled the grass slopes behind them. It was a buoyant meeting. After their unspoken fears had been aired in parliament, the leaders of the five political parties in Malaya, Singapore and Sarawak felt released from their inhibitions and talked freely about the issues of race and a multiracial society, hitherto taboo subjects.</p>
<p class="indent">The convention was Chin Chye’s baby. Although he was not a great orator, he spoke with conviction in his opening speech:</p>
<p class="blq-normal">“This convention is embarked on a crusade to preach interracial unity, to propagate the basic rights of all races which form our multiracial society. The force that will unite all our races into a Malaysian Malaysia is more than language, more than external aggression. Experience has shown that in similar countries, a united nation can arise only if one race does not aspire to be the master race but instead all citizens are equal irrespective of his race.”</p>
<p class="indent">D.R. Seenivasagam of the People’s Progressive Party in Perak was direct and blunt. The convention had become necessary because of a calculated attempt by UMNO leaders to stir up racial feeling. In the face of this threat, other political leaders could not sit back and do nothing. He accused the Alliance of using Article 153 of the constitution on special rights for the Malays to “bully non-Malays”.</p>
<p class="indent"><a class="calibre9" id="page_617"></a>Ong Kee Hui of the Sarawak United People’s Party (later a minister in the federal government) was equally pointed:</p>
<p class="blq-normal">“We see an attitude of intolerance and mounting signs of denial of political equality to people who are non-Malays. For the sake of our country and for ourselves, this must be stopped and the drift to narrow racialism checked. Political equality should be accorded to all who live here and make this country their home irrespective of their racial origin.”</p>
<p class="indent">Dr Lim Chong Eu of the United Democratic Party, moderate and cautious by nature, was not known for his outspokenness. But he felt strongly enough to say:</p>
<p class="blq-normal">“If we fail now to act on what we resolve, there may be no future, and there may be no equitable society for us, or for our children. The most important and the most fundamental attitude which this convention must manifest is the spirit of resolve and steadfastness in the face of the extremely vicious and near-hysterical criticisms which are hurled against us.”</p>
<p class="indent">Michael Buma of the Machinda Party in Sarawak was brilliant. He spoke simply but with tremendous effect. His speech was so devastating that the English newspapers were afraid to publish his punchlines. He said that every time he listened to a radio broadcast from Malaya, the announcer gave the time as <em class="calibre2">Waktu Tanah Melayu</em> – the Time of the Land of the Malays. Why was it not <em class="calibre2">Waktu Tanah Malaysia?</em> So, too, Malayan Railways was known as <em class="calibre2">Kreta Api Tanah Melayu</em> – Railway of the Land of the Malays. Again, why? Simply but effectively, he highlighted the racism.</p>
<p class="indent">The mood of the audience was set before it was my turn to wind up the convention. I referred to the</p>
<p class="blq-normal">“growing truculence, or a heavy racial accent, the intimidatory postures and snarling guttural notes on which they sent out their signals to their followers on the basis of race … if this goes on, <a class="calibre9" id="page_618"></a>Malaysia will not belong to the Malaysians. … They speak on two different wavelengths – one wavelength for multilingual, multiracial consumption, the other, a special VHF meant for their followers. The good men, multiracial men, the top leaders from time to time completely dissociate themselves from this special VHF, but the wild men keep up the pressure.”</p>
<p class="indent">I quoted Dr Lim’s advice to us, based on many years of intimate knowledge of their methods and tactics: “Be resolute, be firm. Never be intimidated.”</p>
<p class="indent">To give heart to the non-Malays, I tabulated the population figures from the last census: 39 per cent Malays, 42 per cent Chinese, about 10 per cent Indians and Pakistanis, 7 per cent Ibans, Kadazans, Kayans, Kelabits and others in North Borneo, and the rest Eurasians, Ceylonese, etc. Whoever played a communal line would be confined to his own racial group, whether it was Chinese or Malay or another. But those who appealed to the people on a non-racial basis stood a fair chance of winning over the 20 per cent minority. I reduced it to a simple formula: 40–40–20. If the Chinese appealed to 40 per cent, using Chinese slogans, they must lose. I left UMNO to conclude what would happen in the long run if they appealed only to the Malays.</p>
<p class="indent">I quoted the chief minister of Malacca, Ghafar Baba (later deputy prime minister), who said, “Look how non-communal the Malays are in Malacca. In a Malay constituency, they voted for Mr Tan Siew Sin.” The chief minister, I said, was an honest man, but</p>
<p class="blq-normal">“every time Mr Tan Siew Sin goes around beating his chest, this is what he represents, the Malays who voted for him. … So, too, with Dato Sambanthan (MIC). He is another honest man. … He said Ja’afar Albar is a good man. Not communal. Do you know why? ‘In my constituency, which is in Perak, Sungei Siput, 90 per cent of the people are Malays, and Dato Albar goes around and tells them to vote for me. So they voted for me.’ Therefore Albar was not a communalist – because he had told the Malays to vote for UMNO’s favourite Chinese and Indian leaders in order that they can then lead the Chinese and Indian communities in the direction UMNO wanted to go!”</p>
