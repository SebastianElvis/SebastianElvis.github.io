<p>The fear expressed by some teachers that students would not learn statistics well if they were permitted to use canned computer programs has not been realized in our experience.<br>A careful monitoring of achievement levels before and after the introduction of computers in the teaching of our course revealed no appreciable change in students&#x2019; performances.</p>
<p>Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>long subject</li>
<li>fear, monitoring: boring nouns, should be converted to verbs</li>
<li>not learn, not been realized: use positive! change to another more suitable word</li>
<li>appreciable: hedge word. no apprechated change -&gt; no detriments</li>

<p>Review of each center&#x2019;s progress in recruitment is important to ensure that the cost involved in maintaining each center&#x2019;s participation is worthwhile.</p>
<p>Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>long subject</li>
<li>review: boring nouns, should be converted to verbs</li>
<li>is: boring verbs. &#x201C;to be&#x201D; is a weak verb</li>
<li>important, worthwhile: vague descriptors. what makes it important/worthwhile? cut them. change to &#x201C;we should&#x201D;, &#x201C;cost-effective&#x201D;</li>
<li>involved in maintaining: clunky phrase</li>

<p>We should review each center&#x2019;s recruitment progress to make sure its continued participation is cost-effective.</p>

<p>It should be emphasized that these proportions generally are not the result of significant increases in moderate and severe injuries, but in many instances reflect mildly injured persons not being seen at a hospital.</p>
<p>Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be emphasized that, generally: Dead weight! They are emphasized because you write them in the paper!</li>
<li>these proportions: not informative. change to an informative adjective.</li>
<li>the result of, in many instances: boring nouns. change to &#x201C;due to&#x201D;, &#x201C;often&#x201D;</li>
<li>being seen: passive, and boring verb.</li>

<p>Shifting proportions in injury severity may reflect stricter hospital admission criteria rather than true increases in moderate and severe injuries.</p>

<p>Important studies to examine the descriptive epidemiology of autism, including the prevalence and changes in the characteristics of the population over time, have begun.</p>

<p>There are multiple other mechanisms that are important, but most of them are suspected to only have a small impact or are only important because of impact on one of the three primary mechanisms.</p>

<p>It is suspected that the importance of temperature has more to do with impacting rates of other reactions than being a mechanism of disinfection itself since ponds are rarely hot enough temperature alone to cause disinfection.</p>
<p>Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is suspected that the importance of temperature: all dead weight. only the word &#x201C;temperature&#x201D; has information</li>
<li>the causality is inverse</li>
</ul>
<p>$$\downarrow$$</p>
<p>Ponds are rarely hot enough for temperature alone to cause disinfection; thus, the effect of temperature is likely mediated through its impact on the rates of other reactions.</p>

<p>It was assumed that due to reduced work at the joints of the lower limbs and less energy loss in the prosthetic leg, running with the dedicated prostheses allows for maximum sprinting at lower metabolic costs than in the healthy ankle joint comples.</p>

<li>It was assumed that: dead weight.</li>

</ul>

<p>The prosthetic leg reduces work and energy loss compared with a healthy ankle joint, which may lead to lower metabolic costs during maximum sprinting.</p>

        <h1 id="Proofs"><a href="#Proofs" class="headerlink" title="Proofs"></a>Proofs</h1><p>A proof is a way of convincing a party of a certain claim.<br>When talking about proofs, we consider two parties: the <strong>prover</strong> and the <strong>verifier</strong>.<br>Given an assertion, the prover&#x2019;s goal is to convince the verifier of the assertion&#x2019;s validity, whereas the verifier&#x2019;s objective is to accept only a correct assertion.</p>
<p>We focus on the verification process rather than finding the proof.<br>The verification is relatively easy while finding a proof is hard.</p>
<p>The proof systems have different types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-Interactive Proof (NP)</li>
<li>Interactive Proof (IP)</li>
<li>PSPACE (proved as = IP)</li>
<li>&#x2026;</li>

Here the following two properties hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completeness</strong>: If $x \in L$, $\exists \pi: V(x, \pi) = 1$.<ul>
<li>For a true assertion $x$ in the language $L$, there is a convincing proof strategy $\pi$ for $V$ to prove $x$ is right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Soundness</strong>: If $x \notin L$, $\forall \pi: V(x, \pi) = 0$.<ul>
<li>For a false assertion $x$ in the language $L$, no convincing proof strategy $\pi$ exists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this definition, $\pi$ is a &#x201C;certificate&#x201D; for $x$.<br>Note that because $V$ is polynomial-time in $|x|$, it is necessary that $\pi \leq p(|x|)$, where $p$ is a polynomial.</p>
